<h1>Thanks for downloading GL4X1, a game launcher for school, uni, etc</h1>

<h3>What is GL4X1?</h3>
<h4>GL4X1 is a game/app library that bypasses most institutions "security" measures
Currently supported software:
	- Minecraft

For games (such as Minecraft), you'll be required to log in to your own personal account if you wish to play online.
This is not neccessary however if you just want to play offline :)
But if you do log in to your personal account, make sure to remove your account from Minecraft when finished.</h4>

<h3>Useful information:</h3>
<h4>On </h4>[this page](https://github.com/GL4X/GL4X1)<h4>, you'll find a list of files:
- The .docx files are game/app files (such as Minecraft-v1.0.docx)
- The single GL4X1-vX.XX.pyc file is the launcher itself. When opened, a window will pop-up that allows you to run the games/apps downloaded previously (the .docx files)

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<h4>1) First, download the </h4>**GL4X1-vX.XX.pyc**<h4> file found </h4>[here](https://github.com/GL4X/GL4X1)<h4>
2) Then, go ahead and download each of the game/app files you want (such as Minecraft-v1.0.docx)
3) Then, simply open the </h4>**GL4X1-vX.XX.pyc**<h4> file on the computer you want to run your games/apps on.
4) Now, to install a game (such as Minecraft), go ahead and click the "install app" button!
5) A new pop-up should appear. Just double click the .docx file that you wish to install (such as Minecraft-v1.0.docx)
Now, GL4X will attempt to install the program to the computer; this may take a while, depending on the app/game you're installing. Please don't try installing multiple apps/games at once as this may crash the launcher.
6) When the installation is complete, you'll get a pop-up box notifying you that it has completed successfully! :)
7) Finally, all you need to do is click the "run app" button on the GL4X launcher to start playing your newly installed game!</h4>


<h3>FaQ:</h3>
<h4>"My institution has GitHub blocked"</h4>
<h5>Try both of the following:
- Download the GL4X.pyc file onto a USB at home, then move it onto the PC at your institution.
or
- Downloaf the GL4X.pyc file at home, email it to yourself, then download it from your email account at your institution.</h5>

<h4>"What do you mean by institution?"</h4>
<h5>- I'm just refering to your school, college, university, etc</h5>

<h4>"What does the 'clear app data' button do?"</h4>
<h5>This just deletes all files related to the GL4X launcher, including any games/apps that were installed. I'd reccommend clicking this button this when you're done using the launcher.</h5>

<h4>"Why are the game files .docx files?"</h4>
<h5>I've named them as if they're word doc files to help bypass any restrictions your school might have put in place.
I've done this as many schools block .zip files.</h5>
